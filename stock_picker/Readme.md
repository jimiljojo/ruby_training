<h1>Stock Picker Problem</h1>
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 1.

```ruby
stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
    => [2,5]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```
